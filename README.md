# N-Queens Problem

## Introduction

This algorithm was created as a project for the course *Artificial Intelligence* of the Athens University of Economics and business.
The algorithm finds a solution to the **N-Queens** problem.

## Problem Explanation

The N-Queens problem is finding a way to place *n* queens on an *n* x *n* chessboard in such a manner, so that the queens do not attack each other (by being in the same row, column or diagonal).

## Algorithm

The problem is solved using the Genetic Algorithm method.
Genetic Algorithm is a method inspired by natural selection. For more information about the *Genetic Algorithm* click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm).
